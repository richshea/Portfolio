MYSQL, HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP

Thinking about the setup:
    Homepage
        four vertical columns 
            blog
            pictures
            videos
            banner

    click on the blog link, get taken to the blog page
    use header printing function to print header
        to allow navigation between the four modules
    use pagebuilder function to print the rest of the page
        supply table (blog, video, pictures)
        supply number of posts to display
        supply select statement
            allows for different orderings



The date field is automatically updated upon record creation but not on update
    
    
CSS notes:
put a style tag in the submit button on the login page for the admin.php page. 
    so you just hit enter and there's no button
    

Questions:
    permalinking to a post?
        posts will have unique ids.
        NO automatically generate select statements?
        a post page with a required id argument. Ids are mutable?

security:
check your db connection security - where to put the password?
        maybe md5 somehow?
create different mysql users for different privileges.
look at all the unquarantined get usage in helper files

to DO: priority -
Write the showblog function now that the blog table is set up - DONE
Write a Delete function for the admin page -DONE
    change so the posts can be expanded and deleting is more explicit.
check your db connection security - where to put the password?
        maybe md5 somehow?
Build in checking for string lengths for posting
manage special characters in posts


Git:
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:richshea/Portfolio.git
git push -u origin master
